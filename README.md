Hi, this is our repo for MagicSemanticSearch, a project by CoolTeamName (Alexandre, Charles, Lina, Tanguy, Victor) ! You can find our progress and weekly reports in the `doc/` folder.

# Installation

To install the required packages, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Do not foget to setup your PYTHONPATH:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$(pwd)/src # if you are in the root of the project
```

# Usage

Our final goal is for you to be able to access a deployed fastAPI instance/web interface where you can search for Magic the Gathering cards using natural language queries.

But for now you have to run the code locally xP.
